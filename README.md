Project: Wordle Project

This MATLAB project is an emulation of the popular word game Wordle.

In addition to basic command window functionality, the script also runs multiple diagnostics on two separate dictionaries (webster-dictionary.txt and words.txt). These diagnostics include work length distribution and the most common letters in each respective dictionary. You can view a full report of this diagnostic and the figures generated in the "Wordle Report.pdf"
